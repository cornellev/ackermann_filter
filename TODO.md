 - Use message covariance, allow constant override in config
 - Incorporate steering angle in ackermann informed calcs
 - Write a proper README
 - Figure out how to make an official ROS2 open source project
 - Make sure the pipelining update frequencies make sense... (should we only update the roots periodically?)
